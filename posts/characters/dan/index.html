  <p>Here you can take a look at Dan Humphrey or &ldquo;Lonley Boy&rdquo;. Dan has an on-again-off-again relationship with Serena van der Woodsen and the two have the longest running relationship on the show. Dan and Serena finally get married in the finale. Dan is good friends with Nate Archibald, Blair Waldorf, and Chuck Bass. To take a closer look at the relations, we have made a graph and a wordcloud that visualizes them.</p>
