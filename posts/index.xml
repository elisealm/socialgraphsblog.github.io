      <description>In gossip Girl, there are alot of family drama and intrigues. The drama is about power, money and romantic relationships. The family drama has left us wondering, which of these families are actually the most powerful? We have therefore chosen to analyze this. We want to see which family is the most powerful, and which has the most contacts. The result is visualized in a network that shows amount of relations the three families have with the characters in gossip girl.</description>
